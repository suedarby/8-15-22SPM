# Sewing Project Manager

## Why?

Every crafter knows the pain of not being able to find something and spending the money on a duplicate even though they “know it’s here somewhere”. To reduce duplication of patterns, notions, fabric and other supplies for sewing & crafts, the Sewing Project Manager was born.

The focus for this project is as follows:

- Projects
- Stash
- Shopping
- Budget
- Dashboard

## The Stack

- Node
- Angular
- Bootstrap
- Firebase
- Google Auth

## Workflow

- User registers with their Google account

- User Logs in

- Presented with a Dashboard with

  - Projects, Shopping list, Budget and Stash

- Projects

  - Future project with a supply list and inspiration

  - Supplies are checked against the stash and if not found added to the shopping list (future feature)

- Shopping List

  - List of items to purchase to complete a project

  - Items to refresh the stash for common items

- Stash

  - Shows what is in the stash

  - Where it is stored

  - Where it was last seen

  - Tracks the quantity of items in the stash and adds to the shopping list when the quantity gets low (future feature)

- Budgets will show if a project is over or under a targeted budget to assist with money management.(future feature)
